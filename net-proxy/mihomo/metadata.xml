    Mihomo Kernel packaged with OpenRC user services in mind.

    It doesn't differ much from <pkg>net-proxy/mihomo</pkg> in gentoo-zh overlay,
    the only difference is that is provides user init-script and uses fcaps to set
    necessary capabilities, since OpenRC user services cannot declare them as system-wide
    services do.
